            Claire Knight is a polyglot remote developer who has worked in many areas of technology over the years. She has been a lead developer for years, which means she has experienced most things the industry can throw at you. Claire currently works at GitHub as part of the Ecosystem API team, where she helps devs all over the world do their best work. She also spends time herding cats from her home office, since that turns out to be great practice for working with developers. Claire lives in Berkshire, UK, with her husband Steve and three cats who from time to time also like to be involved in video calls. When not working, she likes to lift heavy things, only to put them down again.

            </div>

            <p>REST APIs are now used by just about everyone. The same is not true of GraphQL. Even if you understand the potential they hold, getting started is sometimes too simplistic or assumes too much knowledge. This workshop will provide you with the basics to get started, and tips and tricks to help you solve your own problems away from the workshop.</p>

            John Bohannon brings nearly a decade of software engineering experience from industries including defense contracting, medical, and automotive. Ask him about the polymorphic virus he wrote in 8086 assembly and he'll tell you why he's not a hardware engineer anymore. As a Partner Engineer, he is happy to help you find success with GitHub Apps, APIs, and Marketplace. When he's not geeking out about web APIs, he likes running, traveling, and spending time with his family and Boston Terrier.

            Jamie is an engineer on GitHub's Professional Services team, where she enables organizations to become high-achieving with her bespoke solutions. She encourages developers and managers alike to shift their cultural mindsets for greater happiness and faster ships through modern SDLC practices, workflows, and tools for well-tuned and effective DevOps pipelines. She has a background in dance and art history, and has worked at Microsoft, Google, and Nintendo of America. She likes making bad robots, strutting CSS, and documenting all the things. When not nerding out, she trains for triathlons, talks about birds, and travels around in a Westfalia Vanagon with her dog. You should give her book recommendations.

                Extending GitHub workflows with platform primitives
            </div>

            <p>Did you know that GitHub offers APIs that extend your daily GitHub workflow? In this workshop, we'll explore how app creators can leverage platform primitives to programmatically interact with users and render content on the GitHub platform. Come join us to build an app and dial in your daily experience on GitHub.

            Erika has been a Partner Engineering Manager at GitHub since 2018. Erika fell in love with computing from a young age, and spent her time at a computer lab during recess, rather than playing in the school yard. That love of computing and effort allowed her to explore various sectors of technology, including experiences in real-time embedded systems and video game consoles, where she holds several patents. Erika has worn many hats within the industry over the years, but she has found her passion in partner engineering, working to enable powerful integrations with partners.

            <p>In this workshop, participants will explore a quick refresher on GitHub Apps and understand how they differ from GitHub Actions, and when it makes sense to build each. Then we’ll spend some time walking through the conversion of a GitHub App to an Action.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The open source ecosystem, which includes software products, data and methodologies, is a driving force behind many breakthrough achievements in digital technology within the private sector. However, for nonprofits, international aid organizations and others in the social sector, open source adoption remains weak despite its massive potential to improve how the industry functions. In this session you’ll hear about GitHub’s new Open Source for Good program, the specific challenges in OS adoption by social sector, examples of nonprofits that are successfully implementing large scale OS projects and how GitHub can better support OS adoption by the social sector in the future.</p>

            <p>Your business needs to innovate at the same pace of your customers’ fast-changing needs but without sacrificing necessary security and compliance processes. Balancing the tension between speed and risk is key to be successful—and there are lots of team management strategies and tools that can help. Hear from leaders who’ve learned how to strike a balance that works for their organizations and how you can borrow from what they’ve discovered.</p>

                &#34;Good code documents itself&#34; and other lies&#58; Changing work culture through documentation
            </div>

            <p>Most developers have heard “good code documents itself” or “documentation outdates easily, the code does not” at some point. This is an excuse to not write documentation or justify the absence of it. In my work with many teams, the lack of documentation is often a symptom of high technical debt.<br><br>What if we could turn this around and use documentation like a driver for positive culture change and start paying the critical technical debt? This approach not only helps teams to faster identify areas that need critical support but also brings more empathy to the table.<br><br>In this talk, Tania draws on experiences using documentation as a weapon for positive culture and process change in machine learning and scientific computing environments. She focuses on the processes and approaches that enable the creation of documentation for data scientists, infrastructure, and software engineering teams, and clients.<br><br>By the end of the talk, you'll learn efficient techniques to make documentation a first-class citizen in your development cycles—and leave with one or two tricks to convince even the most reluctant developer to document code.</p>

                Insights into GitHub Enterprise&#58; How IBM tracks social coding
            </div>

            <p>How do you track whether GitHub is supporting and increasing the frequency of good coding behaviors like code review, continuous integration, and social coding for your company? When faced with this problem, IBM dove into their instance of GitHub Enterprise. In doing so, they gained insight into how IBM's internal coding practices within GitHub have developed since 2015 and information about the health of the ecosystem that has sprung up within GitHub. In this talk, you'll hear about their methods of investigation that can be applied to any organization and enterprise-specific datasets to apply business context to the data.</p>

                The code behind cars&#58; How GitHub turned Ford into a software company
            </div>

            <p>Ford began writing software in the 1980s using assembly on a Motorola 8065 microcontroller to implement electronic fuel injection. Today, there are dozens of Electronic Control Units controlling the features and functions of modern automobiles. Development environments range from auto code generation using tools like Matlab and Simulink to hand-coded C running on multicore architectures. Writing code that powers vehicles carries unique environmental and regulatory compliance requirements, including functional safety, emissions, and warranty. Ford is transforming the way they think about software, thanks to GitHub. What do they build, what do they buy, and what do they collaborate on are common discussions, not only within Ford, but across the auto industry. Each decision poses unique challenges in how they develop and deploy software to their customers. This talk will discuss the history of software engineering at Ford, some of the unique requirements and challenges faced in their systems—and how GitHub is helping them deliver the products their customers want, with the quality they demand at the speed of the modern software industry.</p>

                Secure container development workflows with Anchore and GitHub Actions
            </div>

            <p>Containers are a driving force behind code reuse for businesses of all sizes, allowing developers to choose from a variety of software sources when they’re building an application. However, containers can sometimes introduce unwanted security and compliance flaws. GitHub’s Steve Winton and Anchore’s Zach Hill will discuss how users can now check containers for known vulnerabilities and configuration issues automatically, thanks to Anchore and GitHub Actions. Plus, they’ll show you some ways you can integrate this new product into your development pipeline.</p>

        <p>
            I have worked for 10 years as a rabbi, community organizer, and educator in places throughout the United States, from Boston to Denver and New York. In my career, I had the opportunity to work with college students on campus, organize against gun violence in Chicago, and lead educational experiences at one of the largest congregations in New York City. After a decade of communal service, I switched gears and attended Flatiron School, a coding boot camp, and currently work as a Developer Advocate at Nexmo, the Vonage API Platform. When I am not writing code or reading blog posts about code, I am spending time with my kids at the beach on the Mediterranean or chasing them through the playgrounds in our neighborhood. I live with my spouse and children in a suburb of Tel Aviv, Israel.

                Building open source communities of starfish
            </div>

            <p>As the world of open source software has exploded and more people enter the field, essential questions around good communication, boundaries of time and space, and how to work on a shared project across cultures, languages, and geography arise. How can we make sure that new contributors who arrive at a project through Hacktoberfest feel inspired to stay? How can we make sure that maintainers, who are already overburdened and overworked, are given the proper tools to do their sometimes thankless work? As a developer who spent ten years working in the fields of non-project management, counseling, and community organizing, Ben will share some strategies on how to create a more holistic environment where everyone thrives, based on lessons sociologists and researchers have learned from starfish and spider communities.</p>

            Erika has been a Partner Engineering Manager at GitHub since 2018. Erika fell in love with computing from a young age, and spent her time at a computer lab during recess, rather than playing in the school yard. That love of computing and effort allowed her to explore various sectors of technology, including experiences in real-time embedded systems and video game consoles, where she holds several patents. Erika has worn many hats within the industry over the years, but she has found her passion in partner engineering, working to enable powerful integrations with partners.

                The modern mainframe&#58; GitHub for social coding and mainframe application development
            </div>

            <p>Rumors of the mainframe's demise have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, mainframe workloads are growing in many Enterprises. Until recently mainframe tooling and development processes have been static - stuck in earlier eras. Non-mainframe developers favor Git and GitHub for their decentralized nature, collaboration, and workflow flexibility. As seasoned mainframe programmers leave the workforce many developers are being hired to enhance, modernize, and manage mainframe applications. This makes the need to provide familiar tools and processes more important than ever.<br><br>Recent innovations in mainframe technology have greatly reduced the barriers to entry, combining modern, standard tooling and development processes with the power and reliability of big iron. This session will cover how businesses can modernize their mainframe development experience with tooling including Git, GitHub, and Jenkins, making it easier for a new generation of developers support growing mainframe workloads.</p>

            <p>What can cities teach open source about governance, funding, and managing limited resources?<br><br>In this talk, we'll take a stroll through von Haussmann's Paris, the subways of NYC and Hong Kong, the streets of Singapore, and modern day San Francisco. We'll look at how the long history of the design, maintenance, economics, and politics of physical infrastructure can inform how we approach our digital infrastructure—and where we'll need to draw a new map for ourselves.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The rising complexity of modern software is pushing the limits of human understanding. Fortunately, visualization is here to help, allowing us to see surprising patterns in data at a glance!<br><br>In this session, you will learn how visualization can help us understand both the static structure and runtime behavior of software. Through visualization, you will gain a deeper understanding of your code, make better-informed design decisions, and have new tools for sharing insights with your team.<br><br>Best of all, visual representations can be a fun and effective way to both explore and explain. We’ll showcase a variety of forkable examples from the Observable community that can help you get started.</p>

            <p>Wonder what's it's like to grow one of the fastest growing open source projects before graduating from high school? Since it's release, 30secondsofcode.org was nominated as the 6th fastest growing open source project by GitHub in 2018, gathered over 45,000 stars, made it to Hacktoberfest trending lists, and started series of education projects used by thousands of developers daily. Growing an organization of this size isn't easy, especially when a newbie is running it. Stefan will share some of his most inspiring and challenging moments of running the organization—and share tips for maintainers and teams starting their own open source projects.</p>

                Machine learning operations with GitHub Actions and Kubernetes
            </div>

            <p>From automating mundane tasks to reducing inefficiencies in developers’ workflows, machine learning has the potential to scale your team’s results like never before. However, the practice of deploying machine learning for enterprises is relatively new. In this talk, Hamel and Jeremy will demonstrate how GitHub Actions and Kubernetes can be used to orchestrate machine learning workflows in new ways that increase transparency and reliability of these applications. By borrowing best practices and technologies from DevOps, they’ll help you learn how to deploy machine learning solutions with confidence.</p>

                Going global&#58; Challenges, considerations, and tips
            </div>

            <p>Ed Huang and Max Liu’s project Codis, a proxy-based high-performance Redis cluster solution, went viral in China five years ago. A year later, when they went to build TiDB and then TiKV, they used those learnings to their advantage—with the goal of building database solutions for and by developers all over the world. In this talk, they’ll discuss the challenges they faced when building a global product, and their solutions, like using a bilingual content strategy and prioritizing global community governance and management.</p>

                Ship happens&#58; shipping pull requests at scale with the merge queue
            </div>

            <p>At Shopify, developers merge and deploy over 400 pull requests each day to Shopify master. Two years ago, we built the merge queue as part of Shipit, an open source project, to control the thundering herd of merges and ensure ships happen quickly and safely. In this talk, Shopify will explore the design of the first iteration of the merge queue, what they've learned from that experience, and how they're evolving the merge queue to continuously scale developer productivity.</p>

            David Lemayian serves as Chief technologist for Code for Africa’s (CfA) network of software / hardware engineering labs in eight countries, and project affiliates in another 10 countries. David has built CfA’s core engineering and data analysis teams from the start, headhunting African digital pioneers and hacktivists to build some of the continent’s earliest open data initiatives. This has included working in support of anti-corruption journalists, progressive government agencies, and crusading human rights NGOs on projects that have ranged from digitising ‘deadwood’ government records to liberate the entity data hidden in the documents, to creating anti-FGM tools and mapping the mafia’s hidden assets across Africa. As CfA matures, David is increasingly building forensic data backbone infrastructure and enterprise-scale solutions that empower citizens with actionable information.

                Exemplars, laggards, and the cautious crew&#58; A data-driven look at practices behind exemplar open source projects
            </div>

            <p>In this session, you'll hear about the year-long collaboration between Gene Kim (researcher and co-author of “The Phoenix Project,” “DevOps Handbook,” “Accelerate”), Dr. Stephen Magill, (expert in software security and program analysis), and Sonatype (maintainers of the Maven Central Repository). They examined 10,000 open source Java components that were published to Maven Central and hosted on GitHub. They combined team and project performance metrics from GitHub, popularity data from Maven Central, and vulnerability and dependency data from Sonatype to examine what properties are shared by exemplary open source teams. They discuss these findings, including the differences we see between exemplary small teams and large teams, the fact that popularity does not predict security, and how remarkably difficult it is to keep dependencies patched while being “almost” up-to-date. They also highlight the organizational and technology practices they observe among exemplar open source teams, which release new versions 2x more frequently and remediate security vulnerabilities 3x more quickly, all while delivering a level of value that makes them standouts in terms of popularity and adoption.</p>

                What does it take to transform a federal agency to a lean, product-focused enterprise?
            </div>

            <p>By shifting the focus away from traditional, plan-driven “project management” (e.g., cost management, schedule management, etc.) towards a more user-driven product management approach (e.g., user research, minimum viable products, etc.), the VA has been working to create the best digital experience for Veterans and business customers. Learn how VA went about this massive cultural shift -- to making human centered design (HCD) a requirement, not a “nice to have.”<br><br>There’s no point in delivering something on-time and on-budget--if it’s the wrong thing.</p>

                Driving ethical change for AI across your organization
            </div>

            <p>As AI becomes more prevalent in our workplaces, it is imperative that solutions are deployed ethically. Organizations need to be cognizant of how they collect and use data, the products they leverage, and the biases that could applied. Most importantly, we need to make sure those who develop algorithms are as diverse as the societies they serve, and that they have the ability to harness the interests and needs of their users. Andrea Gallego, CTO of BCG GAMMA, will explain how GitHub is used by GAMMA’s software and data engineers, data scientists, and analysts to check that unique perspectives and insights are curated and nurtured, and collaboration is tracked and supported across the organization—making GAMMA’s AI solutions more ethical, inclusive, and comprehensive. This talk will help you answer the question&#58; How can we make sure the intelligence we gain from innovations is created and managed ethically?</p>
