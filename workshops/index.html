            Claire Knight is a polyglot remote developer who has worked in many areas of technology over the years. She has been a lead developer for years, which means she has experienced most things the industry can throw at you. Claire currently works at GitHub as part of the Ecosystem API team, where she helps devs all over the world do their best work. She also spends time herding cats from her home office, since that turns out to be great practice for working with developers. Claire lives in Berkshire, UK, with her husband Steve and three cats who from time to time also like to be involved in video calls. When not working, she likes to lift heavy things, only to put them down again.

            </div>

            <p>REST APIs are now used by just about everyone. The same is not true of GraphQL. Even if you understand the potential they hold, getting started is sometimes too simplistic or assumes too much knowledge. This workshop will provide you with the basics to get started, and tips and tricks to help you solve your own problems away from the workshop.</p>

            John Bohannon brings nearly a decade of software engineering experience from industries including defense contracting, medical, and automotive. Ask him about the polymorphic virus he wrote in 8086 assembly and he'll tell you why he's not a hardware engineer anymore. As a Partner Engineer, he is happy to help you find success with GitHub Apps, APIs, and Marketplace. When he's not geeking out about web APIs, he likes running, traveling, and spending time with his family and Boston Terrier.

            Jamie is an engineer on GitHub's Professional Services team, where she enables organizations to become high-achieving with her bespoke solutions. She encourages developers and managers alike to shift their cultural mindsets for greater happiness and faster ships through modern SDLC practices, workflows, and tools for well-tuned and effective DevOps pipelines. She has a background in dance and art history, and has worked at Microsoft, Google, and Nintendo of America. She likes making bad robots, strutting CSS, and documenting all the things. When not nerding out, she trains for triathlons, talks about birds, and travels around in a Westfalia Vanagon with her dog. You should give her book recommendations.

                Extending GitHub workflows with platform primitives
            </div>

            <p>Did you know that GitHub offers APIs that extend your daily GitHub workflow? In this workshop, we'll explore how app creators can leverage platform primitives to programmatically interact with users and render content on the GitHub platform. Come join us to build an app and dial in your daily experience on GitHub.

            Erika has been a Partner Engineering Manager at GitHub since 2018. Erika fell in love with computing from a young age, and spent her time at a computer lab during recess, rather than playing in the school yard. That love of computing and effort allowed her to explore various sectors of technology, including experiences in real-time embedded systems and video game consoles, where she holds several patents. Erika has worn many hats within the industry over the years, but she has found her passion in partner engineering, working to enable powerful integrations with partners.

            <p>In this workshop, participants will explore a quick refresher on GitHub Apps and understand how they differ from GitHub Actions, and when it makes sense to build each. Then we’ll spend some time walking through the conversion of a GitHub App to an Action.</p>

                        Erika has been a Partner Engineering Manager at GitHub since 2018. Erika fell in love with computing from a young age, and spent her time at a computer lab during recess, rather than playing in the school yard. That love of computing and effort allowed her to explore various sectors of technology, including experiences in real-time embedded systems and video game consoles, where she holds several patents. Erika has worn many hats within the industry over the years, but she has found her passion in partner engineering, working to enable powerful integrations with partners.

                                            In this workshop, participants will explore a quick refresher on GitHub Apps and understand how they differ from GitHub Actions, and when it makes sense to build each. Then we’ll spend some time walking through the conversion of a GitHub App to an Action.

                        John Bohannon brings nearly a decade of software engineering experience from industries including defense contracting, medical, and automotive. Ask him about the polymorphic virus he wrote in 8086 assembly and he'll tell you why he's not a hardware engineer anymore. As a Partner Engineer, he is happy to help you find success with GitHub Apps, APIs, and Marketplace. When he's not geeking out about web APIs, he likes running, traveling, and spending time with his family and Boston Terrier.

                                        <p>
                                            In this workshop, we'll cover tooling and frameworks to help you create your own GitHub Actions using JavaScript. Topics will also include best practices for release and publication. We’ll also go hands-on with an interactive experience where we’ll apply our new skills and create a GitHub Action together. Following the workshop, participants will have gained a solid foundation of how to automate their work using GitHub Actions.

                                        <p>
                                            In this workshop, we'll cover tooling and frameworks to help you create your own GitHub Actions using JavaScript. Topics will also include best practices for release and publication. We’ll also go hands-on with an interactive experience where we’ll apply our new skills and create a GitHub Action together. Following the workshop, participants will have gained a solid foundation of how to automate their work using GitHub Actions.

                                            Did you know that GitHub offers APIs that extend your daily GitHub workflow? In this workshop, we'll explore how app creators can leverage platform primitives to programmatically interact with users and render content on the GitHub platform. Come join us to build an app and dial in your daily experience on GitHub.

                        Claire Knight is a polyglot remote developer who has worked in many areas of technology over the years. She has been a lead developer for years, which means she has experienced most things the industry can throw at you. Claire currently works at GitHub as part of the Ecosystem API team, where she helps devs all over the world do their best work. She also spends time herding cats from her home office, since that turns out to be great practice for working with developers. Claire lives in Berkshire, UK, with her husband Steve and three cats who from time to time also like to be involved in video calls. When not working, she likes to lift heavy things, only to put them down again.

                                        <p>
                                            REST APIs are now used by just about everyone. The same is not true of GraphQL. Even if you understand the potential they hold, getting started is sometimes too simplistic or assumes too much knowledge. This workshop will provide you with the basics to get started, and tips and tricks to help you solve your own problems away from the workshop.

                                            In this workshop, participants will explore a quick refresher on GitHub Apps and understand how they differ from GitHub Actions, and when it makes sense to build each. Then we’ll spend some time walking through the conversion of a GitHub App to an Action.

                                        <p>
                                            Containers are a driving force behind code reuse for businesses of all sizes, allowing developers to choose from a variety of software sources when they’re building an application. However, containers can sometimes introduce unwanted security and compliance flaws. GitHub’s Steve Winton and Anchore’s Zach Hill will discuss how users can now check containers for known vulnerabilities and configuration issues automatically, thanks to Anchore and GitHub Actions. Plus, they’ll show you some ways you can integrate this new product into your development pipeline.

                                            GitHub Actions gives us the power to use our repositories to speed up the delivery of our software and applications, all from one central point of truth. This workshop will guide you through hands-on experiences with GitHub Actions to leverage GitHub Package Registry and safely deploy applications to the cloud.

                                            GitHub Actions gives teams world-class CI capabilities, helping developers merge and deploy code many times in a single day. The silent power of GitHub Actions lies in its ability to programmatically define just about any workflow to mirror your team’s processes. Join this workshop to
<ul>
  <li>Create and use multiple, customized workflows to match your team’s processes</li>
  <li>Implement a unit testing framework using GitHub Actions</li>
  <li>Use multiple jobs in a workflow and pass artifacts between jobs</li>
  <li>Configure a repository to work in conjunction with GitHub Actions workflows to implement the team’s processes</li>
</ul>

                                            GitHub Actions gives us the power to use our repositories to speed up the delivery of our software and applications, all from one central point of truth. This workshop will guide you through hands-on experiences with GitHub Actions to leverage GitHub Package Registry and safely deploy applications to the cloud.

                                            Adopting DevOps practices with transparent collaboration may be easier said than done, especially in highly regulated industries like healthcare, government, and financial services.
